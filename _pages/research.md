My long-term research goal is to make AI-enabled autonomous systems work safely and reliably in the real world. To achieve this, I believe in the following roadmap: First, develop scalable and efficient tools to analyze the safety/reliability of learning-enabled systems. Then, use the safety/reliability metrics to orchestrate the design of all learning modules in the autonomy stack until a desirable level of guarantee is satisfied. 

Following this route, my research has been focused on

1. **Developing specialized optimization tools for NNs**: How can we efficiently certify the robustness of NNs and the safety/stability of a dynamical system with NNs in the loop? 

2. **Verification-aided learning of safety certificates and safe policies**: How should learning and verification interact to generate NN certificates or policies with formal guarantees?

3. **Safe learning-based control**: How to correct an unsafe policy online with complex learning dynamics? 

I am broadly interested in machine learning, control, and optimization problems that are related to autonomous system design. If you find my work interesting or have any questions, I am happy to have a discussion.

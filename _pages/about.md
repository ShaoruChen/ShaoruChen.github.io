I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Microsoft Research, NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). Previously, I obtained the Ph.D. degree in electrical and systems engineering from the [University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)](https://www.upenn.edu/). I was advised by Prof. [Victor M. Preciado](https://sites.google.com/site/victormpreciado/). At UPenn, I am also closely working with Prof. [Manfred Morari](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/manfred-morari/), Prof. [George J. Pappas](https://www.georgejpappas.org/index.html), and Prof. [Nikolai Matni](https://nikolaimatni.github.io/). Before coming to UPenn, I received a B.E. degree in Automation from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China, in 2017.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Microsoft Research, NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). Previously, I obtained the Ph.D. degree in electrical and systems engineering from the [University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)](https://www.upenn.edu/). I was advised by Prof. [Victor M. Preciado](https://sites.google.com/site/victormpreciado/). At UPenn, I am also closely working with Prof. [Manfred Morari](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/manfred-morari/), Prof. [George J. Pappas](https://www.georgejpappas.org/index.html), and Prof. [Nikolai Matni](https://nikolaimatni.github.io/). Before coming to UPenn, I received a B.E. degree in Automation from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China, in 2017. 

You can find my CV [here](/files/Shaoru_Chen_CV.pdf) and contact me at **shaoruchen at microsoft dot com**. If you are interested in my research or want to collaborate, please feel free to reach me!

## About my research
My research focuses on developing scalable and efficient verification, optimization, and learning tools for safe control of complex nonlinear and learning-enabled systems with formal guarantees. My long-term research goal is to make AI-enabled autonomous systems work safely and reliably in the real world. To achieve this, I believe in the following roadmap: First, develop scalable and efficient tools to analyze the safety/reliability of learning-enabled systems. Then, use the safety/reliability metrics to orchestrate the design of all learning modules in the autonomy stack until a desirable level of guarantee is satisfied. 

Following this route, my research has been focused on

1. **Developing specialized optimization tools for NNs**: How can we efficiently certify the robustness of NNs and the safety/stability of a dynamical system with NNs in the loop? 

2. **Verification-aided learning of safety certificates and safe policies**: How should learning and verification interact to generate NN certificates or policies with formal guarantees?

3. **Safe learning-based control**: How to correct an unsafe policy online with complex learning dynamics? 

I am broadly interested in machine learning, control, and optimization problems that are related to autonomous system design. If you find my work interesting or have any questions, I am happy to have a discussion.
